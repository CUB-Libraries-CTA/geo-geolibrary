This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages.

The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-109.060204,-102.041522,41.003443999065716,36.992448999092964)", "dct_references_s": "{\"http://schema.org/downloadUrl\":\"https://geo.colorado.edu/apps/geolibrary/datasets/tl_2017_08_tract.zip\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\":\"https://test-geo.colorado.edu/geoserver/geocolorado/wfs\",\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\":\"https://test-geo.colorado.edu/geoserver/geocolorado/wms\"}", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "dct_provenance_s": "University of Colorado Boulder", "dc_subject_sm": ["Census data"], "dct_temporal_sm": [], "dct_issued_s": "2017", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_creator_sm": ["U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division"], "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dc_identifier_s": "https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:47540/5c93bf9c7ba408000a296878", "dc_publisher_s": "U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division", "dct_type_s": "", "uuid": "https://ark.colorado.edu/ark:47540/5c93bf9c7ba408000a296878", "cub_rights_metadata_s": "The organization that has made the Item available believes that the Item is in the Public Domain under the laws of the United States.", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Colorado", "United States"], "layer_id_s": "tl_2017_08_tract0", "dc_title_s": "Census 2010, Colorado, Current Census Tract (2017 revision)", "layer_slug_s": "47540-5c93bf9c7ba408000a296878", "dc_language_s": "English"}, {"dc_description_s": "The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).

The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for 'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The Colorado portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover mapping activities encompassing Federal Region VIII which includes the States of Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data. Partners include the USGS (National Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water Resources Divisions), US EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The USGS NLCD dataset is originally a raster GRID. For conversion to polygons it was filtered with a 5x5 majority filter. This removes the speckle pattern and creates cleaner polygons.
